  <p>
    What Brian has learned is that you can set your <var>GIT_EDITOR</var> environment variable in a way that accepts the standard git merge message.
  </p>

  <p>
    In your <var>.bashrc</var> or <var>.zshrc</var>, add this:
  </p>

  <%- code(`export GIT_EDITOR='true git commit'`) %>

  <p>
    By exporting this <var>GIT_EDITOR</var> value, you are signalling to the Git prompt: üëç and commit!
  </p>
