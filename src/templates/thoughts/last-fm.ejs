description: "Music is a core part of my being. I am constantly looking for my next favorite album. I'm one of those nuts that listens to the same thing over and over until I get sick of it. I use Last.fm to keep track of my listening habits. Here are some of the albums that I have been listening to recently. Check 'em out."

<blockquote>
  To 'scrobble' a song means that when you listen to it, the name of the song is sent to a Web site (for example, Last.fm) and added to your music profile. Here's how it works: Once you've signed up and downloaded Last.fm, you can scrobble songs you listen to on your computer or iPod automatically.
