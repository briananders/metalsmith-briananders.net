He's one of those nuts that listens to the same thing over and over until he's sick of it. Brian uses Last.fm to keep track of his listening habits. Here are some of the albums that he has been listening to recently."

<blockquote>
  To 'scrobble' a song means that when you listen to it, the name of the song is sent to a Web site (for example, Last.fm) and added to your music profile. Here's how it works: Once you've signed up and downloaded Last.fm, you can scrobble songs you listen to on your computer or iPod automatically.
