<blockquote>
  An automaton (plural: automata or automatons) is a self-operating machine, or a machine or control mechanism designed to automatically follow a predetermined sequence of operations, or respond to predetermined instructions.

    Cells are very basic. They are black or white. Alive or dead. Binary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The animation below, is a 1 dimensional world of cells. That one dimension is on the horizontal axis. Time is the vertical axis, moving from the top to the bottom.
  </p>

  <p>
    The way life plays out in this world is absolutely declarative. The second line is derived from the first line, by a series of rules; the third from the second, and so on. There is no free will.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rules are simple.
  </p>
  <list class="p">
    <item>
      1) Each "world" (or Automaton) starts with a single dark cell. I position it in the center.
    </item>
    <item>
      2) Each cell's color, is decided by the 3 cells immediately above it
    </item>
    <item>
      3) The key to each world's evolution is in the "rule"
    </item>
  </list>
  <p>
    Now let's unpack what that means.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each cell's color, is decided by the 3 cells immediately above it, in the shape of a capital T. Those three "parents" form a 3 digit binary sequence. 0 is white and 1 is black. There are 8 possible combinations of white and black values in a string of length 3.
  </p>
  <list class="p">
    <item>000 - 0</item>
    <item>001 - 1</item>
    <item>010 - 2</item>
    <item>011 - 3</item>
    <item>100 - 4</item>
    <item>101 - 5</item>
    <item>110 - 6</item>
    <item>111 - 7</item>
  </list>

  <p>
    Each world has a "rule" that everything is based on numbering from 0 to 255. This page is setup to start with Rule 90. All numbers from 0 to 255 can be represented by an 8 digit binary sequence. In this case, 90 is represented as 1011010.
  </p>

  <p>
    So a cell looks at its parents and uses their coloring as a look-up value against the main rule. If your parents are 101, you will select the 5th value from the right on the main rule's binary value. If it is a 1, the cell is black. Otherwise, it is white.
